An enjoyable board game that is built with only strings (I thought it would be a great challenge). 
It is a game where players throw the dice one after the other until the game ends. The goal is to finish with more money than the opponent.
Stay focused until the end, because in this game everything can happen really quickly. The last round can change the whole game.

It is a board game that I created to have fun with friends, where, as I said before, everything can happen. Each player rolls the dice and decides what to do each time they arrive at a special *box*.
