# RightChoice_Python

One of my earliest programs where I learned a lot about `Python`. 

I created in this program an enjoyable board game that is built with strings alone (I thought it would be a great challenge).

Just like Monopoly, or other similar board games, the players in this game throw dice in order to move their character inside the board where there are different bonuses and happenings that are occuring when a player falls in special places after throwing dice.

The goal is to end up with more money than the opponent when the game ends.

I did not create a bankruptcy system but instead I made it so anything could happen, even the last place player could make it back to the first place if he/she plays it well and has a little bit of luck. The last round can change the whole game.


## How to run

To get started you can `git clone  https://github.com/DYasser/RightChoice_Python.git` and have `Python3` installed. When you have `Python3` installed u can run the file pretty easily either by double clicking or by running it from an IDE.
